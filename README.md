# mixed_module_v4.3.2
The mixed algorithm implemented in the latest version of Singular (v.4.3.2) of the paper [Comprehensive Standard System for Generalized Mixed Module and its Application to Singularity Theory](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219498824502219?journalCode=jaa) by Hiroshi Teramoto and Katsusuke Nabeshima (In what follows, we denote this paper as the paper.). We thank Prof. Ra√∫l Oset Sinha and Dr. Ignacio Breva Ribes in University of Valencia for providing us many examples to test the code, helping to improve efficiency and to fix bugs of this code. We also thank the Singular developpers for fixing bugs of Singular.

To use the libraries, download all the files and place them into a single directory. You will need Singular installed on your machine. We have prepared four examples to demonstrate the libraries:

* [example_codimension_transverse_fold.exe](https://github.com/hiroshi-teramoto/mixed_module_v4.3.2/blob/main/example_codimension_transverse_fold.md)
  - See 3.1.1 Example (transverse fold) in the paper
* example_codimension_beak_to_beak.exe
  - See 3.1.2 Example (beak to beak) in the paper
* [example_divergent_diagram_j1.exe](https://github.com/hiroshi-teramoto/mixed_module_v4.3.2/blob/main/example_divergent_diagram_j1.md)
  - See 4.1.1 Example: Mather's lemma
* [example_complete_transversal.exe](https://github.com/hiroshi-teramoto/mixed_module_v4.3.2/blob/main/example_complete_transversal.md)
  - See 4.1.2 Example: [complete transversal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0951-7715/10/1/017) (with the degree filtration for class 3 in Table.~1 in the paper)
* [example_Ae_quotients.exe](https://github.com/hiroshi-teramoto/mixed_module_v4.3.2/blob/main/example_Ae_quotients.md)
  - Examples to illustrate the computation of the quotients of Ae-tangent space (coming soom!)

To run the codes, in the directory, type 

```
singular example_codimension_transverse_fold.exe
```

We assume you are familiar with Singular. If not please refer to [the singular manual](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-3-2/index.htm#SEC_Top). You can download Singular from [GitHub](https://github.com/Singular/Singular) (The current binary version of Singular (at least at 2024/03/13) contains some bugs in the matrix ordering and the function `sat` to compute the saturation ideal in an exceptional case, which are fixed in the sources. To run the code, compile from the latest source as in the instruction in the GitHub page.).
